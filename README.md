This project is a mission from the Open University of Israel.
The project is actually an assembler that receives input from the user as a command line argument
and a file containing assembly code. The software checks whether there are macro definitions 
in the file and interprets them, then encodes the code into machine code in base 2 
according to the commands and the addressing systems and also creates dynamic arrays of the labels in the software.
The software then goes through the file and replaces the labels with their appropriate code and translates the software code to base 32.
and creates additional files for the internal and external labels.
I have attached the instructions of the project (in Hebrew).
I would appreciate an opinion and a critique of the work. Thanks
